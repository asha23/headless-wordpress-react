# Headless WordPress with React
### A Wordpress/Composer framework.

Get up and running reasonably quickly with a WordPress / React installation

WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT PRODUCTION READY

/headless-wp - This uses a version of create-react-app

There is no theme to speak of. There are a few bits in the headless-react theme but these are just to make sure our custom post types work.

There is an example post type - Movies.

Look in headless-wp/src/app.js to see how this is connected up.

TODO: Remove stuff from the theme we don't need.
TODO: Connect up React in a more modular OO way.
TODO: Connect up the WP MarkDown editor - Get React to parse Markdown correctly.

# Headless WordPress with React
### A Wordpress/Composer framework.

/headless-wp - This uses a version of create-react-app

There is no theme to speak of. There are a few bits in the headless-react theme but these are just to make sure our custom post types work

TODO: Remove stuff from the theme we don't need.
TODO: Connect up react in a more modular OO way
